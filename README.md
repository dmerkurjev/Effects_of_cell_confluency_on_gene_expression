MCF7 RNA-Seq Analysis — Preprocessing & Analysis

This repository contains an end-to-end workflow for RNA-seq analysis of lncRNAs results in tight lncRNA–target couplings. This is an analysis of a gene expression profiling (RNA-seq) and differentail genes expression analyses of MCF-7 cells following estrogen stimulation.

It includes two main components:

Preprocessing (Clean.sh) Downloads SRA runs, builds 8 sample FASTQs, performs QC, alignment, and outputs gene transcription level.

Analysis (Differential_expression.sh) Performs differential expression analysis using edgeR.

Data

SRA BioProject: PRJNA1055006 Gene expression profiling (RNA-seq) and differentail genes expression analyses of MCF-7 cells following estrogen stimulation (after 6 hours) either alone or precultured in transwells with CAFs (for 48 hours). MCF-7 cells alone and without estrogen stimulation is the control condition.

Sample 1: GSM7984517 (SRX22974823) cell line: MCF7 treatment: 0hr estrogen alone

Sample 2: GSM7984518 (SRX22974824) cell line: MCF7 treatment: 0hr estrogen alone

Sample 3: GSM7984519 (SRX22974825) cell line: MCF7 treatment: 0hr estrogen CAF 48hr

Sample 4: GSM7984520 (SRX22974826) cell line: MCF7 treatment: 0hr estrogen CAF 48hr

Sample 5: GSM7984521 (SRX22974827) cell line: MCF7 treatment: 6hr estrogen alone
